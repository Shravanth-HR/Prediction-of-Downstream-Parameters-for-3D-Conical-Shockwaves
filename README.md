# Prediction-of-Downstream-Parameters-for-3D-Conical-Shockwaves
● Developed a Python-based calculation tool to predict downstream flow parameters from supersonic shock conditions, 
adapting logic from NASA’s platform and research sources.
● Extracted, processed, and validated numerical results against published aerodynamic datasets to ensure model accuracy 
and consistency.
● Applied domain-specific equations programmatically to automate multi-variable prediction, demonstrating structured 
problem-solving and scientific data handling.

# Prediction-of-Downstream-Parameters-for-3D-Conical-Shockwaves
Built a Python tool to predict downstream flow parameters from supersonic shock conditions using NASA-based logic. Validated results against aerodynamic datasets and automated multi-variable predictions using domain-specific equations for accurate, structured analysis.
